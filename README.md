 To-Do List Application

This To-Do List application is a Python-based tool that helps you manage tasks effectively. It includes features for editing tasks, prioritizing tasks, setting due dates, and more. The application supports a graphical user interface (GUI) and uses SQLite for advanced storage. User authentication ensures secure access to your tasks.
